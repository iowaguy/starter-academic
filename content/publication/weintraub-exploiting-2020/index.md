abstract: Payment channel networks (PCN) enable scalable blockchain transactions without
  fundamentally changing the underlying distributed ledger algorithm. However, routing
  a payment via multiple channels in a PCN requires locking collateral for potentially
  long periods of time. Adversaries can abuse this mechanism to conduct denial-of-service
  attacks. Previous work on denial-of-service attacks focused on source routing, which
  is unlikely to remain a viable routing approach as these networks grow.
