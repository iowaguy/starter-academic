 abstract = {Payment channel networks (PCN) enable scalable blockchain transactions without fundamentally changing the underlying distributed ledger algorithm. However, routing a payment via multiple channels in a PCN requires locking collateral for potentially long periods of time. Adversaries can abuse this mechanism to conduct denial-of-service attacks. Previous work on denial-of-service attacks focused on source routing, which is unlikely to remain a viable routing approach as these networks grow.},
