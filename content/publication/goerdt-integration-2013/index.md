abstract: The field of modeling and simulation continues to grow and help reduce costs
  and increase development speed in the engineering community, but use of such capabilities
  has been minimal with respect to circuit board visualization and reliability. This
  work responds to this gap with a new simulation-based reliability model for electrical
  components and systems, integrated within a software platform for concurrent analysis.
  While statistics-based reliability analysis is common, this work presents the integration
  of such models in a comprehensive system. The results coupled with a user-friendly
  interface and display in a virtual environment combine to create a novel tool for
  the identification of problem areas and planning for future maintenance of electromechanical
  systems.
