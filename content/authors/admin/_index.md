I am a second year PhD student at Northeastern University in the [Networks and
Distributed Systems Security](https://nds2.ccs.neu.edu/) lab where I work with
Professor [Cristina Nita-Rotaru](http://cnitarot.github.io/). My current
research is focused on privacy-preserving routing in various contexts. In a
previous life, I was a Software Engineer in Silicon Valley.

When I'm not doing computer science, I enjoy reading (mostly non-fiction),
playing ultimate, and backpacking as far from civilization as I can get.
